        <p>Do not run this app in Internet Explorer. Please use a modern browser.</p>
        <p>If data isn't coming back, pressing the "refresh tokens" button might fix that.</p>
        <p>This app consumes SMA's API. It has access via access tokens, which must be refreshed when they expire.
            If refreshing doesn't work, it is because the tokens were manually updated within SMA itself.</p>
        <p>The API can get all applications across all the programs within our system, hence the disparity between the
            number items returned from clicking "All HCCF Apps" and "All App IDs".</p>
        <p>The API requests can be filtered by a number of criteria, as described <a
                href="https://connect.smapply.io/pages/resources.html#applications">here</a>.</p>
        <p>One major shortcoming of the API is that answers to limited choice questions (e.g., radio buttons,
            checkboxes, dropdowns, etc) are stored as integers, and the integer is what the API sends back.
            For example, think of the three risk factors: unhealthy eating, physical inactivity, and tobacco use. For
            each application SMA stores those selections as 0, 1, and 2. It knows that 0 = unhealthy eating, 1 =
            physical inactivity, and 2 = tobacco use. The API doesn't send that mapping, however. It only sends the
            integer. It's therefore up to the consumer of the API to map out the meanings of these integers. What is
            worse, if the mapping changes within our system, for example we add a new risk factor, then that change must
            be manually tracked and changed by the API consumer
            (e.g., some future app leveraging this API).
        </p>
        <p>The "Eligibility Stage Answers" button is slow. This is because one API call is used to get all the app IDs,
            and then, for each application, an API call is made to retrieve that particular application's tasks (i.e.,
            questions ans answers). This means many calls are made sequentially, one after the other. This will get slower as more
            applications are added. A developer must introduce cashing to avoid slowdowns. This means storing tasks as they come back,
            along with their IDs and "last updated" time. Then, when a new requst comes in, check if the stored tasks were updated since last time, and
            only make a call for tasks when there was an update, or when the application is entirely new. Further, we can limit the API to only making calls for
            active applications.
